\section{Introduction}
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science useful in numerous applications. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the output should provide a non-decreasing sequence of numbers as output. More formally, we define a sorting problem as follows\cite{Cormen}.\\
\textbf{Input}: A sequence of $n$ numbers $\langle a_1,a_2, \ldots a_n \rangle$.\\
\textbf{Output}: A recorded sequence (of size $n$) $\langle a_1^`, a_2^`, \ldots a_n^`\rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a_1^` \leq a_2^` \leq \ldots a_n^`$.\\
A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted many researchers who contributed with innovative algorithms to solve the problem of sorting efficiently \cite{Martin}. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on primarily on two aspects,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time complexity} is a formalism that captures running time of an algorithm in terms of the input size. Normally, \textit{asymptotic} behavior on the input size is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
\item \textbf{Space complexity} is a formalism that captures amount of memory used by an algorithm in terms of input size. Like time complexity analysis, asymptotic analysis is used for space complexity.
\end{itemize}
In the branch of algorithms and complexity in computer science, space complexity takes a back seat compared to time complexity. Recently, another parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption has become popular. Roy et al. \cite{Roy} proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting algorithms.

One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{element comparison} are commonly known as \textit{comparison based sorting algorithms}. In this document we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly used comparison based sorting algorithm \cite{Hoare}. \texttt{Quicksort} is a sorting algorithm based on \textit{divide-and-conquer} paradigm of algorithm design. Further, we will derive the lower bound of any comparison based sorting algorithm to be $\Omega (nlog_2n)$ for an input size of $n$.

\section{Quick Sort}
\texttt{Quicksort} is designed as a three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting an input sequence in an array [1]. For any given subarray, $A[i..j]$, the process is as follows,\\
\textbf{Divide:} The array $A[i..j]$ is partitioned into two subarrays $A[i..k]$ and $A[k + 1..j]$ such that all elements in $A[i..k]$ is less than or equal to all elements in $A[k + 1..j]$. A partitioning procedure is called to determine k such that at the end of partitioning, the element at the $k_{th}$ position (i.e., $A[k]$) does not change its position in the final output array.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Partition procedure of \texttt{Quicksort} algorithm}\label{alg:pattern}
      \begin{algorithmic}[1]
          \Procedure{Partition}{$A,i,j$}
              \item [\Comment $A$ is the array of $N$ integers.] 	
              \item [\Comment $i$ and $j$ are the start and end of subarray]
              \State $x \gets A[i] $
              \State $y \gets i-1 $
              \State $z \gets j+1 $
              \While{$(true)$}\label{while1}
              	\State $z \gets z-1 $
                    \While{$A[z] > x$}
                     	\State $z \gets z-1 $
                    \EndWhile
                    \State \textbf{end while}
                    \State $y \gets y+1 $
                    \While{$A[y] < x$}\label{while2}
                        \State $y \gets y+1 $
                    \EndWhile
                    \State \textbf{end while}
                    \If{$y<z$}
                      	\State Swap $A[y] \leftrightarrow A[z]$
                    \Else
                      	\State return $z$
                    \EndIf
          		\State \textbf{end if}
              \EndWhile
              \State \textbf{end while}
          \EndProcedure
          \State \textbf{end procedure}
      \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}\\
\noindent
\textbf{Conquer:}Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two subarrays. This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operations in two sub-arrays.\\
\textbf{Merge:} \texttt{Quicksort} does not require merge or combine operation as the entire array $A[i...j]$ is sorted in place.\\
In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition procedure as shown in Algorithm ~\ref{alg:pattern}. A pivot element x is selected. The first inner while loop (line \#~\ref{while1}) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element. Similarly, the second inner while loop (line \#~\ref{while2}) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the pivot element. If indices $y$ and $z$ have not exchanged their side around the pivot, the elements at $A[y]$ and $A[z]$ are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure returns the index $z$, such that all elements to the left of $z$ are smaller than or equal to $A[z]$ and all elements to the right of $z$ are greater than or equal to $A[z]$.\\
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Quicksort recursion}\label{alg:quicksort}
			\begin{algorithmic}[1]
            \Procedure{Quicksort}{$A,i,j$}
            \item [\Comment Quick Sort Procedure called with A,1,N.]
            	\If{$i<j$}
                	\State $k \gets $ \Call{Partition}{$A,i,j$}
                    \State  \Call{Quicksort}{$A,i,k$}
                    \State  \Call{Quicksort}{$A,k+1,j$}
                \EndIf
                \State \textbf{end if}
            \EndProcedure
			\State \textbf{end procedure}
			\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
The main recursive procedure for \texttt{Quicksort} is presented in Algorithm ~\ref{alg:quicksort}. Initial invocation is performed by call QUICKSORT(A, 1, N) where \textit{N} is the length of array \textit{N}.
\subsection{Time complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an ar-ray of length N, gets partitioned into two subarrays of size N-1 and 1 in every recursive invocation of QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm ~\ref{alg:quicksort}. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm ~\ref{alg:pattern}, takes $\Theta(n)$ time, the recurrence relation for running time is,
\begin{equation*}
T(n) = T(n-1) +\Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
As it is evident that $T(1) = \Theta (1)$, the recurrence is solved as follows,
\begin{align*}
T(n) &= T(n-1) + \Theta(n)\\
     &= \sum_{k=1}^n \Theta (k)\\
     &= \Theta \left( \sum_{k=1}^n k \right)\\
     &= \Theta (n^2) \\
\end{align*}
Therefore, if the partitioning is always maximally unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta (n^2)$. Intuitively, if an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the recurrence for the best case is given by,\\
\begin{equation*}
T(n) = 2T\left( \frac{n}{2} \right) +\Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
which evaluates to $\Theta (n \log{2}n)$. Using a comparatively involved analysis, the average running time of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be $O(n \lg n)$.

\section{Lower bounds on comparison sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms based on comparisons is the following: What is the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms? This question is important for algorithm researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.\\
A decision tree based analysis leads to the following theorem ~\ref{QuickThm}.
\begin{theorem}\label{QuickThm}
Any decision tree that sorts n elements has height $\Omega (n \log_{2}n)$.
\end{theorem}
\textit{Proof} Consider a decision tree of height $h$ that sorts n elements. Since there are $n!$ permutations of n elements, each permutation representing a distinct sorted order, the tree must have at least n! leaves. Since a binary tree of height $h$ has no more than $2^h$ leaves. So,\\
$n! \leq 2^h$\\
Applying logarithmic $(\log_{2}$, the inequality becomes,\\
\\
$h \geq \lg(n!)$.\\
\\
Applying Stirling's approximations,\\
$n! \geq \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n$,\\
where e is the natural bas eof lagarithms. Further,\\
\begin{align*}
h & \geq \lg \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n\\
  & = n \lg n -n \lg e\\
   & = \Omega(n \lg n)
 \end{align*}
